Project Theme:,,To be filled by Azim Premji Foundation team,,
Project Summary:,,"This project aims at empowering girls through education in Kadaladi Block Ramanathapuram District, Tamilnadu. PAD works to advance equality for girls. We will touch upon the root cause of the Child Early and Forced marriage, Arranged marriages & circumstantial marriages and the interventions designed to delay or mitigate child and forced marriage. Our experiences in the field during the present ongoing project shows that the adolescents are engrossed in various issues affecting their future lives such as poor quality education, lack of career guidance, lack of life skills, lack of sports and entertainment facilities, substance abuse, mental health issues etc., this project will mainly addressing these issues in a holistic way in the block .
 The project will contribute towards empowering girls by strengthened capacities of girls and boys, parents, community leaders and government officials on girls’ right to education; increased financing opportunities for girls’ education; strengthened capacity of service providers for addressing girls’ sexual and reproductive health needs; improved gender- responsive school environment for girls and boys; strengthened capacity of girls and boys relating to sexual reproductive health and self protection against violence.
 
 PAD recognises that in most communities, girls suffer disproportionate inequalities with regards to their rights to education. Whereas there is usually greater parity with enrolment rates, more girls drop out of school and do not transit to secondary schools. The project will work with the duty bearers, communities, girls and boys to address the underlying barriers to girls’ education. This project is not a girls-only project since the aim is to address gender inequalities in education based on the local contexts of the target communities. Rallying all stakeholders as promoters of gender equalities is likely to yield better results than having a girls’ specific project in isolation of the underlying issues.",,
