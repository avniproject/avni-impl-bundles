1. Download bundle
2. Unzip bundle under development folder, without locations. e.g. if you downloaded Gram Seva Trust bundle then your files should be like development/gst/formMappings.json, development/gst/identifierSource.json and so on. Recommended to use short names for bundle folders.
3. Open terminal and navigate to avni-impl-bundles (root) folder
- run `make transform-bundle gst`
